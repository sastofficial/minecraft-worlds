This is a datapack that adds survival friendly ways to customize your armor stands.
Just by throwing some items onto the armor stand, you can make it have arms, shrink, show name plates, remove base plates, glow, become invisible, 
and even have custom poses. There are currently 104,190,528 different poses that you can make using this pack. 

HOW TO USE
# get a guide book: drop a regular book on the armor stand to get the guide book. 
# show arms: Drop 2 sticks to add arms, and drop an axe to remove them and get the sticks back.
# no base plate: Drop a pickaxe to remove it.
The removed stone slab will become an item, which you can pick it up and drop it again to add it back.
# invisible: Drop an extended invisibility potion to make it invisible, and drop a milk bucket to make it re-appear.
This will only work when the custom name of the armor stand is set to visible. 
# custom name visible: Drop a sighn to make a floating name plate, and drop a water bucket to remove it.
This also works with fish buckets, and you'll get the sign back.
# glowing: Drop 10 spectral arrows to make it glow, and drop 1 normal arrow to remove the glow. 
# small: Drop blaze powders to cycle between large and small models.
# lock: Drop a lever to lock the armor stand, so that you won't accidentally give the armor stand your items just by right clicking. You cannot customize a locked armor stand either.
Drop the lever again to unlock.
# no gravity: Drop a popped chorus fruit to make the armor stand float. Drop an anvil to give its gravity back.
# tiny rotation adjustments: Drop a regular piston to rotate it 5 degrees clockwise Dropping a sticky piston will do the opposite.
# Posing: Rename a piece of redstone "head," "body," "right arm," "left arm," "right leg," and "left leg," 
and drop it to cycle through all the different poses available for each body part.
# Remote Controlling: Drop a tripwire hook on the armor stand to get a reciever, and drop a book and quill to get the controller. Make the armor stand hold the reciever and then move it around with the controller. 

You cannot customize an armor stand with this datapack if the armor stand is invulnerable or marker.
Tagging an armor stand "locked" wil also stop people from customizing the stand. 
I made this limitation to prevent players from ruining armor stand block models.
You can also tag the armor stand "locked" to stop players from changing it.
